## Orbital Planes

The thirteen **orbital planes** or **true 
planes** are what most people mean when they 
refer to “[the planes](/planes).” These planes
seem to “orbit” the
[material plane](/planes/material) somehow, 
their influence waxing and waning over time. The
planes appear to be tied to [Eberron](/eberron)’s
[moons](/moons), but the cycles of the planes
do not always match the cycles of the moons.

### Concepts

Each of the planes represents a broad, core 
concept of reality.

| Plane | Epithet | Concept |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Daanvi](/daanvi) | The Perfect Order | Order |
| [Dal Quor](/dal-quor) | The Region of Dreams | Dreams |
| [Dolurrh](/dolurrh) | The Region of the Dead | &mdash; |
| [Fernia](/fernia) | The Sea of Flame | Fire |
| [Irian](/irian) | The Eternal Dawn | Positive Energy |
| [Kythri](/kythri) | The Churning Chaos | Chaos |
| [Lamannia](/lamannia) | The Twilight Forest | Nature |
| [Mabar](/mabar) | The Endless Night | Negative Energy |
| [Risia](/risia) | The Plain of Ice | Ice |
| [Shavarath](/shavarath) | The Eternal Battlefield | War |
| [Syrania](/syrania) | The Azure Sky | Peace |
| [Thelanis](/thelanis) | The Faerie Court | Stories |
| [Xoriat](/xoriat) | The Realm of Madness | {{if RealmOfRevelations}}Possibility{{/if}}{{if !RealmOfRevelations}}Madness{{/if}} |

These can be arranged into six 
dialectical pairs:

<table>

<td width="40%">Order (<a

</table>

With the thirteenth, [Dolurrh](/dolurrh), as
the sage [Annolysse of Arcanix](/annolysse-of-arcanix) observed,
lacking an opposite because it does not
represent an idea so much as serve a
cosmic function (that of collecting the
[souls](/soul) of the dead).

### Relationship to the Material Plane

The [Material Plane](/planes/material) is said 
to be _enfolded_ by the thirteen orbital 
planes. Their influence over
[Eberron](/eberron) waxes and wanes in regular cycles, 
but it is also unevenly distributed 
geographically, with some regions showing 
distinctly more or less influence from 
particular planes. This is particularly true 
of [manifest zones](/manifest-zone).

#### Orbit

Each of the thirteen planes is said to have a 
particular “orbit.” The planes cannot be 
observed actually orbiting [Eberron](/eberron) 
as its [moons](/moons) do, but their influence 
can be felt, waxing and waning like those moons.

Each plane has its own distinct orbit, from 
the regimented and predictable orbit of 
[Daanvi](/daanvi) which reliably cycles every 
28 days, to the chaotic orbit of [Kythri](/kythri),
which no sage has yet to discern any pattern
within. Other planes vary in their regularity, 
complexity, and predictability between these
two extremes.

A plane is said to be **coterminous** when its 
influence on the material plane is strongest. 
After this, it begins to **wane** until it is 
**remote**, meaning that its influence on the 
material plane is at its weakest. After this, 
it begins to **wax** until it becomes 
coterminous again. Each plane has different 
effects on Eberron in each stage.

#### Manifest Zones

<p class="main">See <a 
href="/manifest-zone">Manifest Zone</a></p>

**Manifest zones** are areas where one of the 
planes exerts a particularly strong and direct 
influence on [Eberron](/eberron). These 
effects can be amplified by the phase of the 
planar cycle or by the phases of the [moon](/moons)
associated with that plane.

Many of the cities of Eberron have been built on
manifest zones so that they can take advantage of
these properties, making them key elements of
geopolitical strategy through the millennia.
For example, [Sharn](/sharn), the largest city
in [Khorvaire](/khorvaire) known for its
mile-tall towers, was not built by mortal
labor and [magic](/magic) alone, but with the
help of a [Syranian](/syrania) manifest zone
that it exists inside of. This zone does not
manifest that plane’s properties of universal
peace and understanding (as any visitor to the
city could well attest), but it _does_
manifest a propensity towards flight, allowing
the use of magical devices and architecture
(e.g., the [flying buttress](/flying-buttress))
that would simply not have been possible
anywhere else.

Some manifest zones can even
serve as gateways to their plane, though this
is often limited to particular times, like
when the plane is coterminous, or when its
associated moon is full, or ascendant, or all 
three at once.

#### Moons

<p class="main">See <a 
href="/moons">Moons</a></p>

{{if !LifeOnTheMoons}}The moons of [Eberron]
(/eberron) appear to be strongly linked to 
the planes. For example, [Olarune](/olarune) 
is the only moon visible in the night sky over
[Lamannia](/lamannia). Some sages contend that
the moons are essentially small worlds, like
Eberron itself, but closer to the planes,
and so have each been claimed by one of them.
Others contend that they are each their
respective plane’s largest
[manifest zone](/manifest-zone) in the 
[Material Plane](/planes/material) — each one 
a manifest zone the size of a small world. 
Still others maintain that the moons are not 
solid at all, but enormous portals to their 
respective planes.{{/if}}

{{if LifeOnTheMoons}}Each of the moons of 
[Eberron](/eberron) are engulfed entirely 
within a [manifest zone](/manifest-zone) to 
one of the planes — in each case, that plane’s 
largest manifest zone in the
[Material Plane](/planes/material).
{{if MoonPlaneRelationship}}These are vital 
anchors that bind the orbital planes to the 
material plane.{{/if}} Life on each moon has 
been shaped deeply by the influence of its 
respective plane.{{/if}}

| Plane | Moon |
| --- | --- |
| [Daanvi](/daanvi) | [Nymm](/nymm) |
| [Dal Quor](/dal-quor) | {{if LostMoonCrya}}[Crya](/crya){{/if}}{{if !LostMoonCrya}}—{{/if}} |
| [Dolurrh](/dolurrh) | [Aryth](/aryth) |
| [Fernia](/fernia) | [Eyre](/eyre) |
| [Irian](/irian) | [Barrakas](/barrakas) |
| [Kythri](/kythri) | [Zarantyr](/zarantyr) |
| [Lamannia](/lamannia) | [Olarune](/olarune) |
| [Mabar](/mabar) | [Sypheros](/sypheros) |
| [Risia](/risia) | [Dravago](/dravago) |
| [Shavarath](/shavarath) | [Vult](/shavarath) |
| [Syrania](/syrania) | [Therendor](/therendor) |
| [Thelanis](/thelanis) | [Rhaan](/rhaan) |
| [Xoriat](/xoriat) | [Lharvion](/lharvion) |

### Universal Properties

Many of the planes have different universal 
properties than the [Material](/planes/material).
For example, time in [Daanvi](/daanvi) passes 
exactly ten times faster than it does on 
[Eberron](/eberron), while many
[fairy tales](/fairy-tales) hinge on the fact 
that time in [Thelanis](/thelanis) may 
sometimes pass more quickly and other times more
slowly compared to the Material Plane. Fires
burn hotter in [Fernia](/fernia), ice is 
colder in [Risia](/risia),
[transmutation](/magic/transmutation)
[spells](/spell) are more powerful in
[Kythri](/kythri),
[necromancy](/magic/necromancy) spells are 
more powerful in [Mabar](/mabar), healing is 
more potent in [Irian](/irian), weapons deal 
more deadly wounds in [Shavarath](/shavarath), 
and it’s somehow more difficult to think 
aggressive thoughts in [Syrania](/syrania).

### Layers

Many planes have different **layers**. These 
layers vary greatly, manifesting different 
variations of the plane’s core concept. For 
example, [Dolurrh](/dolurrh) has the 
[Catacombs](/dolurrh/catacombs), where the 
souls of dead [humanoids](/creatures/humanoids)
are drawn, the [Kennel](/dolurrh/kennel), 
where [beasts](/creatures/beasts) and 
[monstrosities](/creatures/monstrosities) are 
drawn, the [Crucible](/dolurrh/crucible), 
where the [Smith of Souls](/dolurrh/smith-of-souls)
works, and the
[Vault of Memories](/dolurrh/vault-of-memories),
where the [Librarian](/dolurrh/librarian) 
writes down the memories of every
[shade](/dolurrh/shade) that passes through 
the Region of the Dead.

### Planar Languages

<p class="main">See <a 
href="/languages/planar">Planar Languages</a></p>

Each plane has its own **planar language**. 
This is often (but not always) the native 
language of its immortals. Its mortal 
population may speak it as well, or variant 
dialects based on it. Planar languages often 
figure in [magical](/magic) [spells](/spell),
rituals, and incantations, appearing to hold 
the ability to summon and command elements 
bound to each plane’s concept. For example, 
spells that command fire often use key phrases 
in [Fernian](/fernia/language).

{{if Linguist1}}Linguists speculate that immortal
speakers may explain why these languages seem to
remain unchanging even through millennia, but
others challenge that while this could plausibly
slow the rate of change, arresting it completely
is more difficult to explain. The linguists 
contend that each plane’s language is part of 
what defines the plane — hence the power these 
languages have for arcane magic — and that the 
immortals do not _learn_ language as mortals 
do, but are somehow _made_ from it.{{/if}}

### Inhabitants

#### Immortals

<p class="main">See <a 
href="/immortal">Immortal</a></p>

Most planes produce immortals — eternal beings 
that are bound to the plane’s core concept. 
These include [celestials](/creatures/celestials),
[fiends](/creatures/fiends), and
[elementals](/creatures/elementals). Despite 
their name, immortals can die. They can be 
killed, and some even age and die a natural 
death. But as manifestations of each plane’s 
concept, they are fixed in number. They are 
produced by the plane itself when they are 
needed, and when one dies, another forms to 
take its place. Powerful immortals are more 
likely to reform with their memories and 
personalities intact, while lesser immortals 
may be replaced with a new creature of similar 
temperament and disposition.

Some sages contend that immortals cannot be 
regarded as persons, because, being 
manifestations of cosmic principles and 
concepts, they lack agency. A [balor](/balor) from
[Fernia](/fernia) may burn a city to the 
ground, and may revel in the pain and 
suffering it causes, but it ultimately cannot 
do otherwise. It is a manifestation of fire’s 
ability to destroy, and is thus no more 
morally culpable than the fire itself. The 
mortal arsonist is worthy of punishment 
because he could have chosen to act 
differently, but immortals are simply forces 
of nature.

#### Planarchs

<p class="main">See <a 
href="/planes/planarch">Planarch</a></p>

Planarchs are unique immortals — the most 
powerful of their kind — who embody or define 
a layer of a plane (e.g., the
[Librarian](/dolurrh/librarian) of
[Dolurrh](/dolurrh) or the
[Dark Powers](/mabar/dark-powers) of
[Mabar](/mabar)){{if DalQuorSleeper}}, or, in 
the case of the [Sleeper](/dal-quor/sleeper) 
of [Dal Quor](/dal-quor), perhaps even an 
_entire_ plane{{/if}}. Not all planes have 
planarchs; they seem to exist where the 
plane’s concept require them to exist.

#### Mortals

There are a number of mortal creatures that 
live in the planes. Some originated there, 
like the [eladrin](/creatures/fey/eladrin) of 
[Thelanis](/thelanis), while others migrated 
there from the [Material Plane](/plane/material),
like the [frost giants](/creatures/giants/frost)
of [Risia](/risia). In some instances, mortals 
are subjugated by the immortals of these 
planes. In others, they serve willingly. In 
others still, they form their own communities 
and live out their lives. As in the Material 
Plane, though, mortals are born, grow old, and 
die (within the confines of how time flows on 
that plane). They have agency, can make 
choices, and decide what they wish to do.

#### Manifestations

<p class="main">See <a 
href="/planes/manifestation">Manifestations</a></p>

When a plane requires other participants to 
express its concept, it produces 
**manifestations**.  For example, the
[red dragon](/creatures/dragonkin/dragons/red) 
that consumes a platoon of soldiers in 
[Shavarath](/shavarath) with its fiery breath is 
(usually) not a_real_ red dragon, but a
_manifestation_. It will fight as fiercely as a
real red dragon, its teeth and claws will be just
as sharp (sharper, thanks to Shavarath’s 
universal properties), and its fiery breath will 
consume you just as much as a real dragon’s. 
If you manage to slay it, its corpse will 
crash into the earth and you’ll have the 
chance to savor your victory, but if you 
return a week later, there will be no sign of 
its remains, and a new red dragon will be in 
the sky — swooping down to consume a platoon 
of soldier in its fiery breath. War requires 
enemies, and to be the Eternal Battleground, 
Shavarath produces manifestations like this 
for its denizens to fight against.

Many manifestations appear to be tied to 
living mortals, like the [lumi](/irian/lumi) 
of [Irian](/irian), the [shadows](/madar/shadow)
of [Mabar](/mabar), or the
[conscripts](/shavarath/conscripts) of 
Shavarath, This has led some sages to 
speculate on the nature of a multi-part planar 
[soul](/soul) (which may call into question 
exactly _what_ it is that goes to
[Dolurrh](/dolurrh) when a mortal dies). A few 
sages even speculate that _all_ manifestations 
found in the planes may ultimately be examples 
of this phenomenon.
