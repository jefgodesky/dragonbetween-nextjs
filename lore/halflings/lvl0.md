## Halflings

**Halflings** are a species of [[humanoids]]
native to the [[Talenta Plains]] of [[Khorvaire]]
remarkable for their short stature.

### Physical Variation

Halflings are one of the smallest
[[humanoids|humanoid]] species by both height
and weight. Like most other humanoids, the
differences between males and females are
very slight.

Measurement | Male μ | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Height | 36 in | 2 in | 33 in | 1 in
Weight | 40 lbs. | 4 lbs. | 35 lbs. | 3.5 lbs.

Halflings typically have thick hair on the tops
of their heads. Males can grow equally thick hair
on their lower faces as beards and/or mustaches.
Styling this hair is an important part of halfling
culture. Hair can be straight, curly, or somewhere
in between, with colors ranging from blonde to
red to brown to black, with brown and black being
the most common. As they age, halfling hair
sometimes turns gray and even white.

Skin color in halflings is determined by levels of
melanin, giving rise to a continuum of shades of
brown.
