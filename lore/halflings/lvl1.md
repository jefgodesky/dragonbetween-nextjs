**Halflings** are a species of [[humanoids]]
native to the [[Talenta Plains]] of [[Khorvaire]]
remarkable for their short stature.

### Children of Olladra

While halflings have not, historically, had to
worry much about other humanoids on the
[[Talenta Plains]], they do have [[dinosaurs]],
which have prepared them well for a wider world
dominated by [[humans]] and other creatures of
their size. Halflings live in a world of clumsy
giants, and have adapted to rely on agility and
cunning to outwit them. Halflings have
significantly higher risk tolerance than most
humans. Humans are sometimes called the children
of [[Arawai]] for their apparently supernatural
ability to reproduce with so many other species;
likewise, halflings are sometimes called the
children of [[Olladra]] for their risk-taking
behavior.

### Physical Variation

Halflings are one of the smallest
[[humanoids|humanoid]] species by both height
and weight. Like most other humanoids, the
differences between males and females are
very slight.

Measurement | Male μ | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Height | 36 in | 2 in | 33 in | 1 in
Weight | 40 lbs. | 4 lbs. | 35 lbs. | 3.5 lbs.

Halflings typically have thick hair on the tops
of their heads. Males can grow equally thick hair
on their lower faces as beards and/or mustaches.
Styling this hair is an important part of halfling
culture. Hair can be straight, curly, or somewhere
in between, with colors ranging from blonde to
red to brown to black, with brown and black being
the most common. As they age, halfling hair
sometimes turns gray and even white. The use of
magic or dyes to change hair color is common. In
cultures that hold youth in high regard, this can
be motivated by an attempt to hide one’s age,
hile in cultures that hold their elders in high
regard (like the halflings’ native
[[Talentan culture]]), whitening hair can be a
technique to try to gain greater respect. But,
like cutting or styling hair, coloration is often
chosen for purely aesthetic or personal reasons.

Skin color in halflings is determined by levels of
melanin, giving rise to a continuum of shades of
brown.
