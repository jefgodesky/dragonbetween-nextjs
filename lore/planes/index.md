## Planes

The **planes** are the various 
domains and realms that make up the cosmos. Sages often 
categorize them into the
_[orbital](/planes/orbital)_ and
_[liminal](/planes/liminal)_ planes.

### Orbital Planes

<p class="main">See <a 
href="/planes/orbital">Orbital Planes</a></p>

When most people refer to “the planes,” they 
mean the thirteen **orbital planes**. They are 
referred to as _orbital_ because they seem to 
“orbit” [Eberron](/eberron) somehow, their 
influence waxing and waning over time. The 
planes appear to be tied to Eberron’s
[moons](/moons), but the cycles of the planes 
do not always match the cycles of the moons.

Each of the orbital planes embodies a 
particular concept. Furthermore, these 
concepts appear to occur in dialectical pairs:

</table>

With the thirteenth, [Dolurrh](/dolurrh), as 
the sage [Annolysse of Arcanix](/annolysse-of-arcanix) observed, 
lacking an opposite because it does not 
represent an idea so much as serve a 
cosmic function (that of collecting the
[souls](/soul) of the dead).

The orbital planes exert a powerful influence 
over Eberron. When a plane is **coterminous** 
(meaning that its influence is at its peak), 
its effects can be felt across the planet. 
Likewise, when a plane is **remote** (meaning 
that its influence is at its weakest) its 
absence can be just as powerful.

[Manifest zones](/manifest-zone) are areas 
where a particular plane is particularly 
influential. In many manifest zones, one of 
the plane’s universal properties holds on 
Eberron. For example, the great towers of
[Sharn](/sharn) are not made possible merely 
by mortal labor and [magic](/magic), but also 
by relying on the empowered flight properties 
of [Syrania](/syrania), thanks to the manifest 
zone that the city sits within. Manifest zones 
like these are crucial resources in Eberron, 
with many cities sited to take advantage of 
their effects. Some manifest zones can even 
serve as gateways to their plane, though this 
is often limited to particular times, like 
when the plane is coterminous, or when its 
associated moon is full, or ascendat, or all 
three at once.

### Liminal Planes

<p class="main">See <a 
href="/planes/liminal">Liminal Planes</a></p>

Unlike the orbital planes, the **liminal 
planes** do not represent concepts, but rather 
connect the other planes, serving as a cosmic 
medium or connective tissue. Classically, 
the sages have said that there are two 
liminal planes: the [Astral Plane](/planes/astral) 
and the [Ethereal Plane](/planes/ethereal).

The liminal planes have long posed some 
difficulty for cosmic taxonomists. If we think 
of the liminal planes in terms of the ways in 
which they connect the thirteen orbital planes,
does that make the
[Material Plane](/planes/material) a liminal 
plane as well? On the other hand, if we focus 
on the liminal planes as those which serve a 
cosmic function rather than representing an 
idea, would that make [Dolurrh](/dolurrh) a 
liminal plane?

### Material Plane

<p class="main">See <a 
href="/planes/material">Material Plane</a></p>

The **Material Plane** is the ordinary reality 
that the inhabitants of [Eberron](/eberron) 
experience day-to-day, including the planet 
itself, its twelve [moons](/moons), the
[Ring of Siberys](/ring-of-siberys), the
[sun](/sun), and the [stars](/stars). The 
thirteen orbital planes are said to _enfold_ 
the Material Plane, influencing it as they wax 
and wane.
