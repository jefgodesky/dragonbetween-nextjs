**Humanoids** are [[creatures]] marked by
bipedalism, two pairs of limbs, a head, high
intelligence, and complex social organization.
The major humanoid species of [[Eberron]]
include:

* [[Changelings]]
* [[Dwarves]]
* [[Elves]]
* [[Gnomes]]
* [[Goblinoids]]
    * [[Bugbears]]
    * [[Goblins]]
    * [[Hobgoblins]]
* [[Halflings]]
* [[Humans]]
* [[Orcs]]
* [[Shifters]]

### Hybridization

Most species cannot breed with individuals from
other species, but [[humans]] will produce
[[Half-elves|half-elf]] children with [[elves]]
and [[Half-orcs|half-orc]] children with [[orcs]].

Most half-elves today are the children of
half-elves, rather than mixed human and elf
pairings, though all half-elves have such
parentage somewhere in their ancestry. Half-elves
produce half-elf offspring, but they can do so
with others of their own kind, humans, or elves.
The same is true for half-orcs, who can produce
half-orc offspring with other half-orcs, humans,
or orcs.
