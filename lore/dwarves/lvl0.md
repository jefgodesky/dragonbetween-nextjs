**Dwarves** are a species of [[humanoids]]
marked by small stature (by humanoid standards),
a stocky build, a hearty constitution, and a
long lifespan.

### Physical Variation

There are some small observable differences
between dwarven males and females in terms of
height, weight, and muscle mass, though nowhere
near the differences found in many [[beasts]].

| Measurement | Male μ   | Male σ  | Female μ | Female σ |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Height      | 55 in    | 2 in    | 50 in    | 2 in     |     
| Weight      | 150 lbs. | 15 lbs. | 140 lbs. | 14 lbs.  |

Dwarves have thick hair on the tops of their heads.
Males can grow equally thick hair on their lower
faces as beards and/or mustaches. Hair can be
straight, curly, or somewhere in between, with
colors ranging from blonde to red to brown to
black, with brown and black being the most common.
As they age, dwarven hair often turns gray and
even white.

Skin color in dwarves is most often determined
by levels of melanin, giving rise to a continuum
of shades of black and brown.
