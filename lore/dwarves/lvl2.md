## Dwarves

**Dwarves** are a species of [[humanoids]]
marked by small stature (by humanoid standards),
a stocky build, a hearty constitution, and a
long lifespan.

### Origins

The question of where the dwarves originally came
from is a matter of some debate. [[Mror Culture|Mror]]
oral traditions often refer to “a land of ice
and frost” as their ultimate homeland, though by
no means all. The most popular theory is
that this is the [[Frostfell]], and that the
dwarves migrated from there to [[Sarlona]] and
[[Khorvaire]] through [[demiplane]] passages in
[[Khyber]].

### Narrative Mind

Dwarves reason, relate, and understand the world
through narratives. Dwarves have a reputation
for being materialistic, but they value items
primarily by the stories that they’re bound up
in. Dwarven communities are often built around
family and clan groups, but adoption is common
and genetic relationships seem to hold little
importance. Rather, it is the _story_ of the
family or clan, and the participation of each
member in that story, which is central. The
dwarves who have joined the [[Five Nations]] are
some of the most nationalistic members of those
[[nations]], because they appreciate that the
nation is a _story_ that they are participating
in, much like their families and clans.

### Subterranean Adaptations

Dwarves have [[darkvision]], making darkness
inconvenient for them but not intolerable. Dwarves
raised above ground often prefer sunlight and
color, and when they build subterranean homes
such dwarves will often prioritize windows, even
using a complex arrangement of mirrors to bring
the sun’s light deep underground.

Dwarves’ biological rhythms are more adaptable
than diurnal humanoids like [[humans]]. While it’s
important to maintain a regular schedule, day and
night have little meaning to dwarves. Dwarven
communities are active at all hours, with
different members of the community sleeping and
waking at different times, as best suits each
individual.

Dwarven diets often rely heavily on mushrooms, as
mushrooms are one of the few sources of nutrition
that can be found underground. This fungivorous
diet may explain dwarves’ resistance to such a
wide variety of poisons.

### Physical Variation

There are some small observable differences
between dwarven males and females in terms of
height, weight, and muscle mass, though nowhere
near the differences found in many [[beasts]].

Measurement | Male μ | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Height | 55 in | 2 in | 50 in | 2 in
Weight | 150 lbs. | 15 lbs. | 140 lbs. | 14 lbs.

Dwarves have thick hair on the tops of their heads.
Males can grow equally thick hair on their lower
faces as beards and/or mustaches. A large beard
is often taken as a sign of masculinity among
dwarves, causing dwarves to greatly value their
beards. Hair can be straight, curly, or somewhere
in between, with colors ranging from blonde to
red to brown to black, with brown and black being
the most common. As they age, dwarven hair often
turns gray and even white.

Skin color in dwarves is most often determined
by levels of melanin, giving rise to a continuum
of shades of black and brown.
