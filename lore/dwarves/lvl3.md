**Dwarves** are a species of [[humanoids]]
marked by small stature (by humanoid standards),
a stocky build, a hearty constitution, and a
long lifespan.

### Origins

The question of where the dwarves originally came
from is a matter of some debate. [[Mror Culture|Mror]]
oral traditions often refer to “a land of ice
and frost” as their ultimate homeland, though by
no means all. Only slightly less common is the
claim that the dwarves are the children of the
mountains themselves. The most popular theory is
that this “land of ice and frost” is the
[[Frostfell]], and that the dwarves migrated from
there to [[Sarlona]] and [[Khorvaire]] through
[[demiplane]] passages in [[Khyber]]. Some
proponents of this theory postulate that the
ruins of a lost dwarven civilization might be
found in the Frostfell.

Other scholars contend that the dwarves originally
come from the [[Tashana Tundra]] of Sarlona. The
ancestors of the Mror dwarves sailed west to the
eastern shores of [[Khorvaire]] millennia before
[[Lhazaar]] in this theory. However, critics
point out that there is little evidence of any
cultural connection between the Mror and the
[[Akiak]] dwarves of the Tashana Tundra, and that
there’s also no evidence of any Akiak maritime
tradition, either now or in their past.

A few sages point out that of all [[creatures]],
humanoid or otherwise, it is dwarves alone who
continue to mature, age, and die in [[Risia]].
The reason why dwarves have this unique property
is not known, but some sages contend that it is
because the dwarves are mortal humanoids
originally from the Plain of Ice.
{{if Humanoids4 && Risia4}}Risia’s true concept
is not _ice_ as a natural phenomenon (that is
reflected in the glaciers and blizzards of
certain [[layers]] of [[Lamannia]]), but
stagnation and preservation. As such, did Risia
create dwarves with their distinctively
narrative psychology to explore another aspect
of preservation — preservation in story and
memory?{{/if}} The Tashana Tundra has strong
[[Orbital Planes | planar]]
ties to Risia and frequent planar breaches
through which the dwarves of that plain could
enter the [[material plane]], while other dwarves
could well have come to [[Eberron]] first through
the Frostfell and later found their way to the
[[Ironroot Mountains]] via demiplane passages
through Khyber.

### Narrative Mind

Dwarves reason, relate, and understand the world
through narratives. This is most literal among
the [[Mror culture|Mror]], but the [[Akiak]] 
culture is also built around narratives
(specifically, in their case, [[dreams]]). Dwarves
(and the Mror in particular) have a reputation
for being materialistic, but they value items
primarily by the stories that they’re bound up
in. Dwarven communities are often built around
family and clan groups, but adoption is common
and genetic relationships seem to hold little
importance. Rather, it is the _story_ of the
family or clan, and the participation of each
member in that story, which is central. The
dwarves who have joined the [[Five Nations]] are
some of the most nationalistic members of those
[[nations]], because they appreciate that the
nation is a _story_ that they are participating
in, much like their families and clans.

### Subterranean Adaptations

Dwarves have [[darkvision]], making darkness
inconvenient for them but not intolerable. Dwarves
raised above ground often prefer sunlight and
color, and when they build subterranean homes
such dwarves will often prioritize windows, even
using a complex arrangement of mirrors to bring
the sun’s light deep underground.

Dwarves’ biological rhythms are more adaptable
than diurnal humanoids like [[humans]]. While it’s
important to maintain a regular schedule, day and
night have little meaning to dwarves. Dwarven
communities are active at all hours, with
different members of the community sleeping and
waking at different times, as best suits each
individual.

Dwarven diets often rely heavily on mushrooms, as
mushrooms are one of the few sources of nutrition
that can be found underground. This fungivorous
diet may explain dwarves’ resistance to such a
wide variety of poisons. Some sages have suggested
that the resistance to poison may not be a trait
inherent to the dwarves themselves, but owed to
a fungus that grows in the dwarven gut. Infant
dwarves may be inoculated with the spores from a
young age. What might otherwise be thought of as
a fungal infection does not harm the dwarven host,
but instead analyzes, adapts to, and neutralizes
poisons that the dwarf may ingest.

### Physical Variation

There are some small observable differences
between dwarven males and females in terms of
height, weight, and muscle mass, though nowhere
near the differences found in many [[beasts]].

Measurement | Male μ | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Height | 55 in | 2 in | 50 in | 2 in
Weight | 150 lbs. | 15 lbs. | 140 lbs. | 14 lbs.

Dwarves have thick hair on the tops of their heads.
Males can grow equally thick hair on their lower
faces as beards and/or mustaches. A large beard
is often taken as a sign of masculinity among
dwarves, causing dwarves to greatly value their
beards. Hair can be straight, curly, or somewhere
in between, with colors ranging from blonde to
red to brown to black, with brown and black being
the most common. As they age, dwarven hair often
turns gray and even white.

Skin color in dwarves is most often determined
by levels of melanin, giving rise to a continuum
of shades of black and brown. The [[Akiak]] are
remarkable for their gray skin and bald heads.
The cause for this is unknown.
