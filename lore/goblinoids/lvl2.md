## Goblinoids

**Goblinoids** are a subgroup of [[humanoids]]
native to [[Khorvaire]] consisting of [[bugbears]],
[[goblins]], and [[hobgoblins]]. To some extent,
these species have no more in common with one
another than [[halflings]], [[humans]], and
[[shifters]], but there are several biological
factors that unite the goblinoid species besides
their shared [[history]],
[[Volaarun language|language]], and traditions as
a people: namely, their adaptation to subterranean
environments, certain shared elements of body
language, and a shared goblinoid psychology.

### Subterranean adaptations

All three of the goblinoid species have
[[darkvision]]. Underground, goblinoids often
naturally synchronize sleep patterns into
three overlapping “watches.” About a third of the
community is sleeping at any given time, but the
other two-thirds are awake and on watch. When
above ground, goblinoids adopt a crepuscular
schedule, with a day shift and a night shift.
In the hours around dawn and dusk, though, the
entire community is awake and active to take
advantage of the edge their darkvision grants
them during those hours.

### Body Language

Goblinoid ears are more flexible than those of
other humanoids, with specialized muscles that
allow them to raise, lower, or flick their ears.
[[Hobgoblins]] are known to have particularly
expressive ears, but [[goblins]] and [[bugbears]]
are able to do this as well. This has made ear
movements an important part of goblinoid body
language, shared, expressable, and understandable
by all three species. Many goblinoid cultures have
even developed this into a rudimentary sign
language (which is particularly useful in hunting,
raiding, and war). Two quick flicks of the ear,
for example, is a common signal to “be on guard.”

### Psychology

The goblinoid mind is deeply direct and pragmatic.
Goblinoids are by no means bereft of emotion,
interiority, or psychological depth, but they are
much more concerned with the pragmatic needs of
life in the world than navigating social networks
and relationships.

Goblinoids respond to hierarchy and authority
better than humans. Though any goblinoid would
rather be on top of a hierarchy than subjected to
it, they do not experience as much distress from
lower social status as humans do. Goblinoids in
charge of hierarchies are more pragmatic and
less cruel in positions of dominance than many
other humanoids, seeing it as a pragmatic
arrangement, a means to an end, rather than a
vindication of personal worth. That’s not to say
that goblinoids cannot be cruel; on the contrary,
[[Darguun]] is the site of some of the worst
atrocities in [[Khorvaire]] today. But goblinoids
are cruel for a reason. They might be cruel to
break the wills of their slaves, to suppress a
would-be challenger, or to demand more work. It
is rare for goblinoids to use their power to
indulge their sadism or needlessly assert their
dominance. This is not a matter of their virtue;
they simply don’t see what that would prove.

This pragmatism limits goblinoids’ capacity for
pure, abstract thought. [[Religion]] is by no
means unheard of among goblinoids, but it is
rare, particularly compared to other humanoids.
[[Divine magic|Divine spellcasting]] is
exceptionally rare among them. Their inherently
rational, pragmatic minds make faith difficult
(though not impossible) for them. For the same
reason, they tend to prefer [[history]] to
fiction.  While the [[Bards|bardic]] traditions
of the _[[duur'kala]]_ are ancient and revered,
they are oral historians more than storytellers.
