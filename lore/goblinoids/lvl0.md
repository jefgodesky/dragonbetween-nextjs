**Goblinoids** are a subgroup of [[humanoids]]
native to [[Khorvaire]] consisting of [[bugbears]],
[[goblins]], and [[hobgoblins]]. This is a
purely cultural grouping, though, based on their
shared [[history]] and
[[Volaarun language|language]]. Biologically,
goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears have no more
in common with one another than [[halflings]],
[[humans]], and [[ogres]].
