**Goblinoids** are a subgroup of [[humanoids]]
native to [[Khorvaire]] consisting of [[bugbears]],
[[goblins]], and [[hobgoblins]]. To some extent,
these species have no more in common with one
another than [[halflings]], [[humans]], and
[[shifters]], but there are several biological
factors that unite the goblinoid species besides
their shared [[history]],
[[Volaarun language|language]], and traditions as
a people: namely, their adaptation to subterranean
environments and a shared goblinoid psychology.

### Subterranean adaptations

All three of the goblinoid species have
[[darkvision]]. Underground, goblinoids often
naturally synchronize sleep patterns into
three overlapping “watches.” About a third of the
community is sleeping at any given time, but the
other two-thirds are awake and on watch. When
above ground, goblinoids adopt a crepuscular
schedule, with a day shift and a night shift.
In the hours around dawn and dusk, though, the
entire community is awake and active to take
advantage of the edge their darkvision grants
them during those hours.

### Psychology

The goblinoid mind is deeply direct and pragmatic.
They are lawfully inclined, seeking structure and
hierarchy. They prefer to work in large groups
with a clear plan of action and chain of command.
This doesn’t always make goblinoids law-abiding
citizens, but it does mean that they are inclined
to work with others and obey authorities within
their own communities.

It is said to be for this reason that so many
goblinoids struggle with pure abstract thought
and [[Religion|religious faith]]. It is said that
there are no [[Divine magic|divine spellcasters]]
among the goblinoids.
