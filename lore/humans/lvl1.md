## Humans

**Humans** are a widespread species of
[[humanoids]] native to [[Sarlona]].
{{if KhorvaireHistory1}}The first humans in
[[Khorvaire]] migrated to the continent roughly
three millennia ago. In the centuries since, they
have come to dominate the continent.{{/if}}

### Breeding

Humans are often called “the children of
[[Arawai]]” because of their apparently
supernatural reproductive abilities. The most
numerous examples of human fecundity are
[[half-elves]] and [[half-orcs]], ultimately
the result of human pairings with [[elves]] and
[[orcs]], respectively.

### Diurnal Creatures

Humans are diurnal creatures. They have a
circadian rhythm that naturally aligns with the
daily cycle. They feel most comfortable in the
daylight. They cannot see in the dark, and so
are less comfortable at night, and even more
uncomfortable underground, where they don’t even
have the light of the twelve [[moons]], the
[[stars]], or the [[Ring of Siberys]] to guide
them. As such, all but the most dense human
settlements will typically become more quiet
late at night, with many establishments — even
those referred to as “night life” — closing only
a few hours after midnight.

### Physical Variation

There are some small observable differences
between human males and females in terms of
height, weight, and muscle mass, though nowhere
near the differences found in many [[beasts]].

Measurement | Male μ | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Height | 70 in | 3 in | 64.5 in | 2.5 in
Weight | 190 lbs. | 20 lbs. | 170 lbs. | 18 lbs.

Humans typically have thick hair on the tops of
their heads. Males can grow equally thick hair on
their lower faces as beards and/or mustaches.
Styling this hair is an important part of human
culture. Hair can be straight, curly, or somewhere
in between, with colors ranging from blonde to
red to brown to black, with brown and black being
the most common. As they age, human hair sometimes
turns gray and even white.

Skin color in humans is determined by levels of
melanin, giving rise to a continuum of shades of
black and brown. Brown or olive tones are the
most common, but black and white is found in
certain populations as well.
