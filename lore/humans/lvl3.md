**Humans** are a widespread species of
[[humanoids]] native to [[Sarlona]].
{{if KhorvaireHistory1}}The first humans in
[[Khorvaire]] migrated to the continent roughly
three millennia ago. In the centuries since, they
have come to dominate the continent.{{/if}}

### Breeding

Humans are often called “the children of
[[Arawai]]” because of their apparently
supernatural reproductive abilities. While the
ability of individuals to produce offspring with
others outside of their own species is often less
clear-cut than primary school education would
suggest, humans present a particularly prolific
case that frustrates any attempt at biological
taxonomy.

The most numerous examples of human fecundity
are [[half-elves]] and [[half-orcs]], ultimately
the result of human pairings with [[elves]] and
[[orcs]], respectively. It is the [[planetouched]],
though, who raise the most profound questions
about how powerful this human gift may be.

Breeding pairs are the foundational unit of most
human societies across [[history]] and around
[[Eberron]]. Humans cement political alliances
through marriages to produce offspring which
belong to both communities at once. They have
sex for pleasure — something that is, while not
unique to them, certainly not the norm. The
major events that human cultures mark in their
life cycles are usually not moments of magical
transformation or [[Planes|planar]] orientation,
but stages of sexual maturity. Humans often think
of themselves as a sort of “default” that other
[[humanoids]] deviate from in one way or another,
failing to see the ways in which they are as
unique as any other, but this is simply a matter
of human perspective. To other humanoids, it is
fairly obvious to see that humans stand out as
the most sexually active and promiscuous of
the group.

### Social Mind

Compared to [[Goblinoids|goblinoid]] rationality
or [[Orcs|orcish]] passions, human cognition
follows the basic model of a social network. This
has led to speculation that a key pressure in
the development of the human mind was tracking
and understanding social groups — not only who
each person in the group was, but also the
relationship of each person in the group with
each other person in the group. This suggests that
the earliest humans in [[Sarlona]] must have
lived in small bands of no more than 150 people.
In fact, groups of 15, 50, and 150 recur in
human societies across [[history]] and around
[[Eberron]], suggesting that these may be
natural limits within the human mind.

Even when contemplating abstract concepts or
thinking logically, a close examination of human
thought reveals that even the wisest sages
reason by first understanding abstract concepts
as persons, and then understanding the
relationships between those concepts in terms of
social relations. Social organization is the
fundamental metaphor which, it would seem,
humans _must_ apply to truly understand anything.

### Diurnal Creatures

Humans are diurnal creatures. They have a
circadian rhythm that naturally aligns with the
daily cycle. They feel most comfortable in the
daylight. They cannot see in the dark, and so
are less comfortable at night, and even more
uncomfortable underground, where they don’t even
have the light of the twelve [[moons]], the
[[stars]], or the [[Ring of Siberys]] to guide
them. As such, all but the most dense human
settlements will typically become more quiet
late at night, with many establishments — even
those referred to as “night life” — closing only
a few hours after midnight.

### Physical Variation

There are some small observable differences
between human males and females in terms of
height, weight, and muscle mass, though nowhere
near the differences found in many [[beasts]].

Measurement | Male μ | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Height | 70 in | 3 in | 64.5 in | 2.5 in
Weight | 190 lbs. | 20 lbs. | 170 lbs. | 18 lbs.

Humans typically have thick hair on the tops of
their heads. Males can grow equally thick hair on
their lower faces as beards and/or mustaches.
Styling this hair is an important part of human
culture. Hair can be straight, curly, or somewhere
in between, with colors ranging from blonde to
red to brown to black, with brown and black being
the most common. As they age, human hair sometimes
turns gray and even white. The use of [[magic]]
or dyes to change hair color is common. In
cultures that hold youth in high regard, this can
be motivated by an attempt to hide one’s age,
while in cultures that hold their elders in high
regard, whitening hair can be a technique to
try to gain greater respect. But, like cutting or
styling hair, coloration is often chosen for
purely aesthetic or personal reasons.

Skin color in humans is determined by levels of
melanin, giving rise to a continuum of shades of
black and brown. Brown or olive tones are the
most common, but black skin is common among
populations that can trace their ancestry back
to [[Corvagura]] or [[Pyrine]], with the
[[Magic|magical]] and [[Orbital Planes|planar]]
influences on those regions creating the modern
stereotypes of such people as sacred and magical.
White skin can be found among populations that
can trace their ancestry back to [[Dor Maleer]],
with the associations of white people being cold
and closer to death owing to the same magical
and planar influence on _that_ region.
