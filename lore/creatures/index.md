A **creature**, in [[Eberron]], is any living
being, not just an animal. It is a category that
includes [[plants]] as well as such supernatural
beings as [[fiends]] and [[celestials]]. Sages
typically refer to 14 categories of creatures:

* [[Aberrations]]
* [[Beasts]]
* [[Celestials]]
* [[Constructs]]
* [[Dragonkin]]
* [[Elementals]]
* [[Fey]]
* [[Fiends]]
* [[Giants]]
* [[Humanoids]]
* [[Monstrosities]]
* [[Oozes]]
* [[Plants]]
* [[Undead]]

{{if Arcana1}}Though these categories seem
arbitrary, there is some apparent reality to them,
as proven by the effects of [[arcane magic]]. For
example, while [[Natural philosophy | natural
philosophers]] may contend that fungi have more
in common with beasts than plants, the fact that
one can cast _[[speak with plants]]_ to speak
with a [[shrieker]] or a [[greatpine]] proves
that there is some sort of common magical nature
that unites the two.{{/if}}
