## Elves

**Elves** are exceptionally long-lived
[[humanoids]] that have habituated to the
[[material plane]], though they are descended
from the [[eladrin]] — [[fey]] [[mortals]] native
to [[Thelanis]].

### Origins

{{if XendrikHistory4}}During the [[Age of Giants]],
[[Shae Tirias Tolai]] was captured and sacked
by the [[cloud giants|cloud]] and [[storm giants]]
of the [[Cul'sir Dominion]]. Its eladrin
population was enslaved. These slaves did not
remain the sole property of the Cul’sir for long,
though, as they soon sold them to the other
giant empires. It was the [[Sulat League]] who
[[magebreeding|magebred]] the [[drow]] to police
their other elf slaves (and these, too, quickly
spread to the other giant empires).{{/if}}
{{if XendrikHistory3 && !XendrikHistory4}}During
the [[Age of Giants]], the [[Cul'sir Dominion]]
captured one of the [[feyspires]] when it entered
the [[material plane]]. Its eladrin population was
enslaved. These slaves did not remain the sole
property of the Cul’sir for long, though, as they
soon sold them to the other giant empires. It was
the [[Sulat League]] who [[magebreeding|magebred]]
the [[drow]] to polive their other elf slaves
(and these, too, quickly spread to the other giant
empires).{{/if}}{{if !XendrikHistory3}}The elves
are the descendants of eladrin who were captured
and enslaved by the ancient [[giant]] empires of
[[Xen'drik]].{{/if}} For tens of thousands of
years — countless generations, even for elven
lifespans — the elves remained in bondage, during
which time their connection to [[Thelanis]] faded.
[[Spells]] that target [[fey]] creatures do not
work on elves, but those that target [[humanoids]]
do, proving that a fundamental transformation
occurred among the elves during that time.

{{if XendrikHistory4}}The [[Quori Invasion]]
{{if LostMoonCrya}}and the destruction of the
lost moon, [[Crya]]{{/if}} weakened the giant
empires. The elves took advantage of the
opportunity provided to rise up against their
masters.{{/if}}{{if !XendrikHistory4}}When the
giant empires began to decline, the elves rose
up against their masters.{{/if}}
{{if AerenalHistory1}}The modern
[[Aereni culture|Aereni]] and
[[Tairnadal culture|Tairnadal]] cultures alike
are fundamentally shaped, even 40,000 years later,
by the long guerilla campaign that followed. For
both cultures, preserving the heroes of that
conflict has become a singular, even obsessive
focus. Most of the [[Tairnadal ancestors|ancestors]]
that the Tairnadal revere were the great heroes
of the war, and [[Aerenal]] itself bears the name
of the great elven hero, [[Aeren]], who foresaw
the fall of the giant empires and led the elves
to safety there.{{/if}}

After the fall of the giant empires of [[Xen'drik]],
the elves divided into two major cultures in
[[Aerenal]] — the [[Aereni culture|Aereni]] and
the [[Tairnadal culture|Tairnadal]].
{{if MarkOfDeath}}After the appearance of the
[[Mark of Death]], the [[line of Vol]] began
[[magebreeding]] experiments with rogue [[dragons]]
to enhance their mark. When this was discovered,
the [[Undying Court]] and [[Argonnessen]] entered
into an unprecedented alliance to wipe them out.
In the short civil war that followed, the ancestors
of [[House Phiarlan]] sided with their fellow
[[dragonmarks|dragonmarked]] elves. When the
conflict was over, they and those who sided with
them were forced into exile in [[Khorvaire]].
They became the ancestors of a third population
of elves: the [[Khorvairian elves|Khorvairian]]
or “city” elves who largely set aside the old
ways of [[Aerenal]] to assimilate into the
cultures of the [[Five Nations]].{{/if}}
{{if Khorvaire && !MarkOfDeath}}2,600 years ago,
a number of elves migrated from [[Aerenal]] to
[[Khorvaire]], including the ancestors of
[[House Phiarlan]]. They became the ancestors of
a third population of elves: the
[[Khorvairian elves|Khorvairian]] or “city”
elves who largely set aside the old ways of
[[Aerenal]] to assimilate into the cultures of
the [[Five Nations]].{{/if}}

### Long Life

Besides [[dragons]] and trees, elves are among
the most long-lived [[mortals]] in the
[[material plane]]. Every elven culture has
developed a different way of dealing with this,
but it is at the heart of each one. It can be
difficult for elves to take other species
seriously, when they have comparatively so little
time to learn, grow, or accomplish anything of
note.

{{if AerenalHistory1}}Take the
[[Aereni culture|Aereni]] as an example. They
have developed a powerful arcane civilization,
but for generations their focus has been on
preserving the glories of their past. Aereni
mages are capable of [[magic|magical]] feats
unheard of in the [[Five Nations]], but they
spend their centuries trying to cast their
[[spells]] _precisely_ as their ancestors did.
The Aereni are an isolationist culture with little
interest in the affairs of places like
[[Khorvaire]] — after all, what could such
short-lived creatures have to offer them? It is
true that the arcanists of Khorvaire have yet to
match the arcane mastery of Aerenal, let alone
overtake it, but it is also true that while the
Aereni have maintained the same level of magical
power for 40,000 years, the short-lived
[[humans]] of Khorvaire (and the
[[dragonmarked houses]] in particular) have made
huge leaps in arcane science and engineering in
just three millennia — a span of time that covers
just a few generations of elves. It is only the
most cosmpolitan and worldly members of the
isolationist Aereni society who have even noticed
this trend, and only the most humble of those
who have recognized its significance.{{/if}}

### Trance

Elves do not sleep; instead, they enter a
[[trance]] for roughly four hours each day, during
which time they are semi-conscious in a deep,
meditative state.

{{if Elf}}
When elf children enter a trance, they experience
vivid memories of things they could not possibly
have witnessed or may have never happened. Some
believe that young elves are [[dreams|dreaming]],
while others believe that these are the memories
of their ancestors. The first time that an elf
relives an experience of their own is called the
First Reflection. It is an important moment in
an elf’s life, definitively marking the beginning
of adolescence. This ordinarily occurs in the
second or third decade of an elf’s life.

Throughout adolescence, an elf’s trance focuses
more and more on reliving their own lived
experiences, reinforcing their training and
education. The Drawing of the Veil is a term
used to describe this transition. When it is
complete, and an elf’s trance is entirely focused
on hens own lived experiences, hen has become
an adult. This ordinarily occurs at the end of
the first century of an elf’s life. This can be
traumatic for some young elves. Most elven
cultures have rites of passage to help their
young navigate this transition.

As elves mature, they learn to curate the
memories that they relive in trance, using it to
reinforce their training, or to focus on joy and
beauty to console themselves in dark times. This
is part of why elves feel so driven to collect
positive experiences, because they will be able
to vividly relive those experiences over and over
again for centuries to come — and may ultimately
have to live inside them.

Elves continue as mature adults for many
centuries, but in time their trances begin to
grow longer. This is a slow process, referred to
as the Reverie, but over the course of centuries
the trance grows longer and longer, until the
elf no longer rouses from it.

### Physical Variation

Even among humanoids (a group marked by its
distinct lack of sexual dimorphism), elves are
particularly androgynous. Gender does not play
a strong role in many elven cultures, and
genderfluidity is quite common among them.

Measurement | Male μ | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Height | 66 in | 3 in | 63 in | 3 in
Weight | 120 lbs. | 5 lbs. | 115 lbs. | 5 lbs.

Elves typically stand slightly shorter than
[[humans]], with slight, gracile builds. They
have triangular faces, sharp noses and chins,
and large, upturned eyes.

Elf hair is usually straight, and comes in a
dazzling array of colors, as does their skin.
