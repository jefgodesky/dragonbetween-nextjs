**Elves** are exceptionally long-lived
[[humanoids]] that have habituated to the
[[material plane]], though they are descended
from the [[eladrin]] — [[fey]] [[mortals]] native
to [[Thelanis]].

### Long Life

Besides [[dragons]] and trees, elves are among
the most long-lived [[mortals]] in the
[[material plane]]. It can be
difficult for elves to take other species
seriously, when they have comparatively so little
time to learn, grow, or accomplish anything of
note.

### Trance

Elves do not sleep; instead, they enter a
[[trance]] for roughly four hours each day, during
which time they are semi-conscious in a deep,
meditative state.

{{if Elf}}
When elf children enter a trance, they experience
vivid memories of things they could not possibly
have witnessed or may have never happened. Some
believe that young elves are [[dreams|dreaming]],
while others believe that these are the memories
of their ancestors. The first time that an elf
relives an experience of their own is called the
First Reflection. It is an important moment in
an elf’s life, definitively marking the beginning
of adolescence. This ordinarily occurs in the
second or third decade of an elf’s life.

Throughout adolescence, an elf’s trance focuses
more and more on reliving their own lived
experiences, reinforcing their training and
education. The Drawing of the Veil is a term
used to describe this transition. When it is
complete, and an elf’s trance is entirely focused
on hens own lived experiences, hen has become
an adult. This ordinarily occurs at the end of
the first century of an elf’s life. This can be
traumatic for some young elves. Most elven
cultures have rites of passage to help their
young navigate this transition.

As elves mature, they learn to curate the
memories that they relive in trance, using it to
reinforce their training, or to focus on joy and
beauty to console themselves in dark times. This
is part of why elves feel so driven to collect
positive experiences, because they will be able
to vividly relive those experiences over and over
again for centuries to come — and may ultimately
have to live inside them.

Elves continue as mature adults for many
centuries, but in time their trances begin to
grow longer. This is a slow process, referred to
as the Reverie, but over the course of centuries
the trance grows longer and longer, until the
elf no longer rouses from it.

### Physical Variation

Even among humanoids (a group marked by its
distinct lack of sexual dimorphism), elves are
particularly androgynous. Gender does not play
a strong role in many elven cultures, and
genderfluidity is quite common among them.

| Measurement | Male μ   | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ |
|-------------|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Height      | 66 in    | 3 in   | 63 in    | 3 in     |     
| Weight      | 120 lbs. | 5 lbs. | 115 lbs. | 5 lbs.   |

Elves typically stand slightly shorter than
[[humans]], with slight, gracile builds. They
have triangular faces, sharp noses and chins,
and large, upturned eyes.

Elf hair is usually straight, and comes in a
dazzling array of colors, as does their skin.
