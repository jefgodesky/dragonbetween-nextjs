## Changelings

**Changelings** are a species of [[humanoids]]
capable of changing their appearance at will.
For changelings, changing height (within a few
inches), weight (within a dozen pounds or so),
eye color, skin color, hair color, facial
structure, and other such changes is as effortless
as standing up is for [[humans]] (and, like
humans, being unable to do so is considered a
disability among them). With practice, talent,
or concentrated effort, changelings can make
more profound changes, even altering their
internal biology.

### Origins

Myths about the creation of changelings routinely
credit [[the Traveler]] as the species’ creator
or at least divine benefactor. The Traveler plays
an important role in many changeling societies
and communities. Nomadic changelings are often
called [[Travelers]], with the comparison to the
Sovereign of Chaos and Change not being entirely
coincidental.

It is a common belief that changelings are the
result of [[humans]] interbreeding with
doppelgangers, while others maintain that it is
the changelings who came first, and that
doppelgangers were created by the [[Daelkyr]]
by manipulating and reshaping changelings. These
contending theories mirror similar discussions
about [[shifters]] and [[lycanthropy|lycanthropes]],
suggesting that these views might have come from
some mischievous changelings pulling someone’s
leg, or perhaps engaged in a more far-reaching
intrigue. You see, doppelgangers _are_ changelings.
The difference between a doppelganger and a
changeling is not the difference between a
human and an [[orcs|orc]], but the difference
between a human and a knight. With the right
equipment, training, and dedication, any human
could become a knight. Likewise, changelings
who focus on developing their shapeshifting
abilities and unlocking their latent [[psionic]]
talents — whether through intense training,
religious devotion to the Traveler, the ancient
traditions of [[Ohr Kaluun]] or some other arcane
transformation — become doppelgangers.

Changelings are found across [[Khorvaire]] and
[[Sarlona]], though they may have come to
Khorvaire alongside [[humans]]. Linguists point
out that the [[Volaarun language|Volaarun]]
pejorative _gaa’ma_ (literally “wax baby”) is
found across Khorvaire, suggesting that the term
may have been coined {{if Dhakaan}}during the
[[Empire of Dhakaan]]{{/if}}{{if !Dhakaan}}when
the continent was dominated by an ancient
[[goblinoids|goblinoid]] empire{{/if}}, pushing
back the changeling history in Khorvaire back
thousands of years. Critics point out that the
_[[duur'kala]]_ travel between Volaarun-speaking
communities, and could just as easily spread the
term _without_ invoking an ancient changeling
history in Khorvaire. It’s difficult to tell
because changelings often blend into the society
of the humanoids around them, leaving little
direct evidence of themselves. For example, an
urban legend popular among changelings despite
a dearth of historical evidence is that
[[Galifar ir'Wynarn|King Galifar I]] was
actually a changeling.

Some sages insist that there is some deep
kinship between changelings and [[mimics]], and
there does seem to be some reason to believe
that this is true, but the nature of the
connection remains uncertain.

### Body Language

In addition to the sorts of typical body language
that changelings learn from their society, they
also learn to employ casual shapeshifting as an
additional means of communication. Changelings
can shift the color of their eyes, hair, or skin
to express their mood or create artistic patterns
on their skin. When a changeling bites hens
thumb at someone or gives them the horns, hen
can do with a fiendish hand to underline the point.

### Gender, Sexuality & Reproduction

Changelings can take on masculine, feminine,
or androgynous characteristics with ease. With
a bit of effort and concentration, they can even
rearrange their internal biology to produce a
functional uterus or functional testes.
Genderfluidity is quite common among changelings,
but those who do see themselves as one gender or
another find it much easier to maintain the
biology of that sex, and find it more difficult
to maintain the other. Some changelings see this
as a reason to avoid tying themselves to a single
gender, while others consider it the reason to
do so.

Changelings reproduce sexually like all other
humanoids, and amongst themselves as you would
expect. When in the form of a particular humanoid
species, they can parent young of that species
with others — for example, while in the form of
a [[Bugbears|bugbear]], a changeling can couple
with a bugbear and conceive a child. There is a
50% chance that a child so conceived will be of
the species of the non-changeling parent (e.g.,
in our previous example, a bugbear), and a 50%
chance that it will be a changeling.

Pregnancy can complicate a changeling’s abilities,
particularly when bearing a non-changeling fetus.
While changeling fetuses typically survive so
long as the mother does not take any form that
lacks a uterus, non-changeling fetuses have a
more difficult time adapting to such changes. If
this occurs early in the pregnancy, the fetus is
often simply reabsorbed by the mother, ending the
pregnancy but not causing any damage. The later
in the pregnancy this happens, though, the more
likely a traumatic miscarriage becomes, which
can cause injury and, in some cases, even death
for the mother. Changeling mothers are encouraged
to maintain a single form throughout pregnancy
to avoid these complications, but shifting form
provides changelings with an effortless and
nearly undetectable way to end a pregnancy at
will.

### Changeling Philosophies

Changelings have a relationship to identity that
few other beings can fully appreciate. For them,
identity can be like a set of clothes, something
to put on and take off as needed. Most changelings
curate a collection of personas that they can
use, and changeling communities often have
communal personas that everyone in the community
shares. Particularly with these communal personas,
it becomes evident how much of a person is a
story or role to be played. A changeling who
takes on the role of the local priest Father Hes
takes on a responsibility to maintain Father Hes’s
Hes-ness, to act as Father Hes would act, rather
than how hen would necessarily act. A changeling’s
own personas are ones that hen has chosen and
created, but they are each still different.
Acting like one while in the form of another
would risk ruining the utility of both. Many
changelings carry this through in their view of
other humanoids and how they understand them,
having an easier time recognizing when someone is
simply playing out a role and the expectations
placed upon hen.

This gives rise to three distinct philosophies
that are often found in changeling communities,
or are adopted by individual changelings in the
world. Each of these has been elaborated upon and
developed into many various branches of philosophy
and praxis, with communities dedicated to each.

#### Passers

<p class="main">See <a href="/passers">Passers</a></p>

Passers believe in assimilation and blending in.
These changelings will typically adopt a single
identity (usually a member of the dominant
species in their community) and, if all goes well,
live out their lives as that person without ever
changing form again. Changelings often face
prejudice and mistrust, so these changelings
often treat their nature as a terrible secret
that they must keep hidden at all costs. When
passers are discovered, the community’s reaction
is rarely positive, and frequently violent. This
is often because of anti-changeling bigotry, but
that can also be fanned by the feelings of
betrayal and wondering what other secrets the
hidden changeling might be harboring. This
reaction, in turn, encourages more changelings
to become passers to survive.

Passers try to avoid having changeling children.
They sometimes take the risk of conceiving
children with other humanoids, but if that child
is a changeling, hen may be given up for adoption,
abandoned, or in some cases even killed. There
are stories of passer parents attempting to swap
their changeling babies for other humanoid infants
in some communities. When a passer does keep a
changeling child, they typically isolate them
until they’re old enough to control their
abilities. Instilling in them that they must
never let anyone know what they are is drilled
deep into them.

#### Becomers

<p class="main">See <a href="/becomers">Becomers</a></p>

Becomers believe that truth is relative, and thus,
to truly understand the world, one must experience
it from multiple perspectives. Becomers often
entertain beliefs about the [[transmigration of souls]]
or life as a means by which [[Eberron]] comes to
know herself, but they see changelings as
particularly well-suited to this task, able to
live and compare a multitude of experiences in a
single conscious lifetime. Thus, some Becomers
elevate the cultivation of a wide range of
personas as a sort of sacred calling. Becomers
emphasize the cultivation of a dual consciousness
in which one’s “true self” and the persona one
portrays are equally true at any given moment,
an idea they sometimes refer to as
[[the Truth of Now]].

For Becomers, some personas are favorites that
they return to regularly, while they might sample
others only a few times before discarding them.
Becomers are the changelings most likely to
maintain genderfluidity and see the assumption of
a single gender as a hindrance, or even a
disability.

Becomers are known for loving and accepting their
children however they are born, but sometimes
with a clear preference for their changeling
children. They sometimes have a hard time not
seeing their non-changeling children as
handicapped, as they will only ever experience
the world from a single point of view. Some
Becomer parents begin cultivating personas
closer to such child’s experiences so they can
better relate to them.

{{if Khorvaire}}
Most stories that circulate about changelings
in Khorvaire are about Becomers. The legend of
[[Bin]] is a well-known folk tale regarding a
particularly libidinous Becomer changeling and
his amorous escapades. The story of
[[Madam Mas and the Bard]] is another favorite,
describing an event with a talented changeling
[[Bards|bard]] in [[Sharn]].

#### Reality Seekers

<p class="main">See <a href="/reality-seekers">Reality Seekers</a></p>

Reality seekers (sometimes called _perfecters_)
believe that an ultimate Truth and a Perfect Form
exist, and dedicate themselves to it. Reality
seekers take a strong stance against any form
of deception. Reality seekers typically appear
in their natural form. They experiment with
other forms not to develop personas, but to try
to find the Perfect Form.

Reality seekers see truth, honesty, and trust as
the foundations of their relations to such a
degree that they can find it difficult to live
with anyone who _isn’t_ a reality seeker. As such,
many reality seeker communities become isolated,
utopian experiments. Group marriage and
polyamory is common in these communities.
Children are raised by the community as a whole
rather than just their parents. Changeling
children are highly valued and taught from a
young age to explore their shapeshifting abilities
as well as more relaxed, featureless forms. All
children, changeling or otherwise, are taught
the importance of honesty and encouraged to ask
questions fearlessly and pursue the truth wherever
it may lie.
