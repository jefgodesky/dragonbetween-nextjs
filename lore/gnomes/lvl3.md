**Gnomes** are a species of [[humanoids]] native
to [[Thelanis]] and naturalized to [[Khorvaire]]
marked by their small stature and [[fey]]
ancestry. It is said that [[halflings]] are to
[[humans]] what gnomes are to [[elves]].

### Origins

The scholars of the [[Library of Korranberg]]
assume that the gnomes of [[Eberron]] must be
descended from the gnomes of [[Pylas Pyrial]],
a [[feyspire]] that appears from time to time
in [[Zilargo]]. Gnomes must have been entering
[[Khorvaire]] this way as far back as the
[[Age of Monsters]], as {{if Dhakaan}}the
[[Empire of Dhakaan|Dhakaani]] [[Ghuurash Codex]]
makes{{/if}}{{if !Dhakaan}}ancient [[Goblinoids|goblinoid]]
records make{{/if}} mention of “jungle rats”
that they defeated and enslaved between the
[[Howling Peaks]] and the [[Seawall Mountains]].
{{if Dhakaan && KhorvaireHistory4}}The gnomes
fought a long, covert campaign of resistance
against their goblinoid occupiers and slavers,
sabotaging their infrastructure and sparking
conflict amongst them. When the empire fell, the
gnomes seized the secrets left behind in the
Dhakaani cities _and_ those left behind by the
[[Daelkyr]].{{/if}}

In the [[Modern Age]], the gnomes organized
themselves into clans and families, eventually
forming three city-states: [[Trolanport]],
[[Korranberg]], and [[Zolanberg]]. They became
Khorvaire’s first major seafaring people, and
welcomed the first [[humans|human]] settlers from
[[Sarlona]]. According to gnomish histories, it
was they, rather than humans, who were most active
in spreading the [[Khorvairian language]] across
the continent.

[[Dorius Alyre ir'Korran]] was perhaps the most
critical figure in gnomish history. He vowed to
gather so much information that his knowledge
would surpass even that of [[Aureon]], and so he
would ascend and take the Sovereign’s place. His
success in his stated aim is a matter for
theologians to debate (or scoff at as blasphemous
hubris, as seems more likely), but ir’Korran’s
quest did yield a number of revolutionary tomes,
from the _[[Planar Codex]]_ to the
_[[Codex of All Mysteries]]_, and more
importantly, led to the foundation of the
[[Library of Korranberg]]. The three city-states
worked together to support it, forming
[[the Triumvirate]]. In the time of
[[Karrn the Conqueror]], this Triumvirate would
expand its powers to protect the gnomes from
human conquest, forming the nation of [[Zilargo]].
A group originally formed to protect the Library
of Korranberg and its vast collections, founded
long ago by a gnome known only by hens title
as “the Proctor,” became [[The Trust of Zilargo|the
Trust]]. Two years after the founding of Zilargo,
the Trust made its existence known. Those who
chose to abide by it remained and became the
ancestors of today’s [[Zil culture|Zil]] gnomes.
Those who refused left Zilargo, becoming the
ancestors of the gnomes of the [[Five Nations]]
and [[Lorghallen]].

### Curiosity

Curiosity is a trait common to all humanoid
species, but in no species is it felt as acutely
as it is among gnomes. We might find a normal
distribution of curiosity in all humanoid species,
and the same would be true of gnomes as well,
but the _average_ for the gnomish distribution
would be two standard deviations above the
human average. A remarkably apathetic gnome is
as curious as the average human, and the most
curious humans find themselves in good company
with average gnomes. The pursuit of knowledge —
all knowledge, _any_ knowledge — is an
all-consuming element for all gnomish societies.
What sort of knowledge they pursue and how varies
widely, making each society and each person in
each society unique, but it is the hunger for
knowledge that unites all gnomes.

It is very common for gnomes to search for
knowledge in books, becoming scholars, sages,
and researchers. The [[Library of Korranberg]]
is the greatest library in [[Khorvaire]] — perhaps
even in all of [[Eberron]]. Where else could a
library create a nation, other than among gnomes?
The [[Mark of Scribing]] appeared among gnomes,
which may reflect their [[fey]] ancestry and ties
to [[Thelanis]], a [[Orbital Planes|plane]]
ruled by storybook logic, and its connection to
[[Rhaan]], “the Book.” Words and letters are a
means of storing and conveying knowledge that are
dear to many gnomes, and which have deeply
influenced the way they think and see the world.
Eloquence and wordplay are much appreciated by
most gnomes.

Other gnomes dedicate themselves to the pursuit
of new knowledge as arcanists, artificers, and
inventors, trying to invent new techniques or
[[spells]], or discover new arcane principles.
There are a great many gnomish explorers for the
same reason. These gnomes also rely on the written
word, not to discover knowledge but to record it
and share it with the world.

The most stereotypical outlet for gnomish
curiosity, though, is intrigue. Gnomes —
[[Zil culture|Zil]] gnomes in particular — have
a reputation for deception and subterfuge. In
[[Zilargo]], this is often treated as a sort of
sport. The gnomes of the [[Five Nations]] more
often live by the social and moral expectations
of the society they live in, though the gnomish
drive to collect knowledge _does_ lead a
disproportionate number of them into careers in
intelligence, analysis, and espionage.

### Physical Variation

There are some small observable differences
between gnomish males and females in terms of
height, weight, and muscle mass, though nowhere
near the differences found in many [[beasts]].

| Measurement | Male μ  | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ |
|-------------|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| Height      | 44 in   | 2 in   | 40 in    | 2 in     |
| Weight      | 45 lbs. | 4 lbs. | 35 lbs.  | 3 lbs.   |

Gnomes are one of the smallest humanoid species,
smaller even than [[halflings]]. They have pointed
ears, chiseled facial features, high cheekbones,
and sharp jaws. Gnome skin tones range from tan
to brown to gray. Their hair can be almost any
color, including white, blonde, brown, orange,
or green.

Gnomes can live for as long as three centuries,
but begin showing their age after their first.
Their hair grows white and their skin becomes
wrinkled and weathered. Despite the outward signs
of aging, gnomes can remain fit and active for
another two centuries after this. As a result,
quite a few of the gnomes encountered in
[[Eberron]] are tiny, wrinkled creatures with
snow-white hair who would appear to be ancient
and decrepit, who are then quite capable of
surprising you with their speed and agility —
to say nothing of their razor wit.
