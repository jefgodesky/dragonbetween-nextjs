## Gnomes

**Gnomes** are a species of [[humanoids]] native
to [[Thelanis]] and naturalized to [[Khorvaire]]
marked by their small stature and [[fey]]
ancestry. It is said that [[halflings]] are to
[[humans]] what gnomes are to [[elves]].

### Curiosity

Curiosity is a trait common to all humanoid
species, but in no species is it felt as acutely
as it is among gnomes. We might find a normal
distribution of curiosity in all humanoid species,
and the same would be true of gnomes as well,
but the _average_ for the gnomish distribution
would be two standard deviations above the
human average. A remarkably apathetic gnome is
as curious as the average human, and the most
curious humans find themselves in good company
with average gnomes. The pursuit of knowledge —
all knowledge, _any_ knowledge — is an
all-consuming element for all gnomish societies.
What sort of knowledge they pursue and how varies
widely, making each society and each person in
each society unique, but it is the hunger for
knowledge that unites all gnomes.

It is very common for gnomes to search for
knowledge in books, becoming scholars, sages,
and researchers. The [[Library of Korranberg]]
is the greatest library in [[Khorvaire]] — perhaps
even in all of [[Eberron]]. Where else could a
library create a nation, other than among gnomes?
The [[Mark of Scribing]] appeared among gnomes,
which may reflect their [[fey]] ancestry and ties
to [[Thelanis]], a [[Orbital Planes|plane]]
ruled by storybook logic, and its connection to
[[Rhaan]], “the Book.” Words and letters are a
means of storing and conveying knowledge that are
dear to many gnomes, and which have deeply
influenced the way they think and see the world.
Eloquence and wordplay are much appreciated by
most gnomes.

Other gnomes dedicate themselves to the pursuit
of new knowledge as arcanists, artificers, and
inventors, trying to invent new techniques or
[[spells]], or discover new arcane principles.
There are a great many gnomish explorers for the
same reason. These gnomes also rely on the written
word, not to discover knowledge but to record it
and share it with the world.

The most stereotypical outlet for gnomish
curiosity, though, is intrigue. Gnomes —
[[Zil culture|Zil]] gnomes in particular — have
a reputation for deception and subterfuge. In
[[Zilargo]], this is often treated as a sort of
sport. The gnomes of the [[Five Nations]] more
often live by the social and moral expectations
of the society they live in, though the gnomish
drive to collect knowledge _does_ lead a
disproportionate number of them into careers in
intelligence, analysis, and espionage.

### Physical Variation

There are some small observable differences
between gnomish males and females in terms of
height, weight, and muscle mass, though nowhere
near the differences found in many [[beasts]].

Measurement | Male μ | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Height | 44 in | 2 in | 40 in | 2 in
Weight | 45 lbs. | 4 lbs. | 35 lbs. | 3 lbs.

Gnomes are one of the smallest humanoid species,
smaller even than [[halflings]]. They have pointed
ears, chiseled facial features, high cheekbones,
and sharp jaws. Gnome skin tones range from tan
to brown to gray. Their hair can be almost any
color, including white, blonde, brown, orange,
or green.
