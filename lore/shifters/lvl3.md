**Shifters** (sometimes also referred to as
**weretouched**) are a species of [[humanoids]]
noted for their bestial features. Shifters are
able to make these features even more prominent
for a time in a magico-physicological process
referred to as _shifting_.

### Origins

In the [[Five Nations]], it is commonly believed
that shifters are the product of [[humans|human]]
breeding with [[lycanthropes]], producing a hybrid
species that have some diluted features common to
natural-born lycanthropes.
{{if Shifter || EldeenReaches3 || KhorvaireHistory3}}Many
shifter cultures, including the tribes of the
[[Towering Wood]], hold that the opposite is true:
that _they_ came first, and that lycanthropes were
made _from them_, whether by the [[Wild Heart]],
the [[daelkyr]], or some other sinister force.{{/if}}

Shifters are found today in [[Khorvaire]],
[[Sarlona]], and [[Xen'drik]], and though their
historical spread on the latter continent is a
matter of [[history|historical record]], the
question of how they came to people the former
two remains open. The shifter tribes of the
[[Towering Wood]] insist that they have resided
there for millennia, which would place them in
Khorvaire long before the migrations of [[Lhazaar]].
{{if EldeenReaches3}}Archaeological evidence
supports this claim, forcing proponents of a
Sarlonan origin to explain an early shifter
migration. This could have been a matter of
migrating through demiplanes in [[Khyber]], as
has been posited for the [[dwarves]], but other
oral traditions among the shifter tribes refer to
a notable familiarity with [[Lamannia]], which
could mean that Sarlonan shifters entered the
Twilight Forest through any one of that continent’s
myriad [[manifest zones]] or other [[planes|planar]]
phenomena, and then traveled from that plane to
the Towering Wood through that forest’s particularly
strong connection to that particular plane.{{/if}}
{{if !EldeenReaches3}}Some proponents of a Sarlonan
origin entertain these claims and contrive various
[[plane|planar]] migration paths by which shifters
may have migrated from Sarlona to Khorvaire, but
others simply dismiss such claims as nothing more
than primitive mythology.{{/if}}

Of course, the same planar migration routes that
could explain a shifter migration from Sarlona to
Khorvaire before Lhazaar could equally explain a
migration in the opposite direction, from Khorvaire
to Sarlona. {{if EldeenReaches3 || Humanoids4}}There
are some who advance an ancient kinship between
[[orcs]] and shifters, pointing to evidence of
orcs in the [[Towering Wood]] in the [[Age of Demons]]
and linking their disappearance to the appearance
of the first shifters. These claims generally
take some form of the orcs of the Towering Wood
being transformed for one reason or another into
the first shifters. One particularly provocative
possibility (though as yet completely unsupported)
speculates that there was a lycanthropic outbreak
not unlike the one which led to the
[[Silver Crusade]] of the [[ninth century]],
which dealt a blow to the orc population from
which it would never recover. Those who did
survive performed some powerful, primal ritual
that bound the forces responsible for the outbreak
within their bodies collectively, transforming
them into the first shifters and sapping enough
power from the forces responsible for the
outbreak to bring it to an end. Though a compelling
story, it remains complete speculation, based
almost entirely on the coincidence that the orcs
disappeared from the Towering Wood at the same
time that the first shifters apparently appeared
there, so few sages pay much attention to it as
anything more than a pseudo-historical fable.{{/if}}

### The Beast Within

At some point in adolescence, shifter children
undergo a physical and psychological transformation
in which they come into contact with _the beast
within_. If this connection is in any way
physiological, it follows a pattern that no
genealogist, anthropologist, or sage has yet to
map. It seems to be a purely spiritual connection.
In the [[Moonspeakers|Moonspeaker]]
tradition of the [[Towering Wood]], these are
identified with five powerful totemic spirits:

* [[Grandmother Bear]] embodies strength and
wisdom. She is ferocious in the protection of
her children, but in contrast to her brother,
Grandfather Boar, she rarely acts rashly.
* [[Grandfather Boar]] embodies endurance and
strength. He is honored for his forthright honesty
and lack of guile, but is often reckless, overly
enthusiastic, and prone to rash action.
* [[Grandfather Rat]] is clever and stealthy. He
lacks physical strength, so he uses his speed and
cunning to escape his enemies.
* [[Grandmother Tiger]] is the greatest hunter,
the very embodiment of strength, speed, and grace,
but she shuns the company of others and always
hunt alone.
* [[Grandmother Wolf]] is considered wise and
honorable. She understands the importance of the
pack and is the keeper of [[Druids|druidic]]
mysteries.

{{if Shifter || Druidry3 || EldeenReaches3}}A few
others, like [[Brother Raven]], are also known,
but they are not nearly as common, and are typically
addressed as siblings, rather than given the
honorifics of grandparents.{{/if}}

The beast within shapes a shifter on a fundamental
level. Physiologically, shifters take on the shape
of the beast: those connected to the Tiger take on
more feline characteristics, while those connected
to the Wolf take on more canine features. The
beast also comes to shape them psychologically,
whether by the shifter’s acceptance of its
influence, or her resistance to it. The beast
within provides a raw connection to instinct that
few members of other species can understand, which
can mean an extreme of passion and emotion that
can easily dominate a shifter’s thoughts and
actions. Some shifters accept this: a shifter
connected to the Rat may endeavor to become the
greatest embodiment of Grandfather Rat that he
can be. Other shifters struggle against it, to
the extent of suppressing all emotion and
remaining stoic in the face of any situation, lest
their deep passions overwhelm them. Shifters are
thus generally mercurial and hot-tempered, whether
they express that freely or strive to control it.

#### Bear Shifters

Bear shifters tend to be large and hairy. They can
often be sensitive and gentle, but they can also
be gruff and intimidating. Bear shifters can be
fiercely protective of those they love, and are
known for being stubborn and refusing to back down
from any argument or confrontation. They are also
deep sleepers and talented dreamers who frequently
become spiritual leaders in shifter communities.

#### Boar Shifters

Boar shifters tend to be large and stocky, with
a squat, powerful physique and bristly hair. They
are direct, straightforward, and honest — not
infrequently to the point of rudeness. Because
they are so honest themselves, it rarely occurs
to them to expect dishonesty from others, often
making them particularly naive. Boar shifters
are often diligent, concentrating intensely on a
single goal once they set their minds on it.
They rarely seek help from others, but don’t
hesitate to help others when they ask.

#### Rat Shifters

Rat shifters tend to be small, lean, and wiry,
with pronounced teeth and pointed noses. They are
quick and smart, with unparalleled reflexes. Rat
shifters are often jumpy and nervous, even to the
point of paranoia in extreme cases. They often
find it easy to justify dishonest or manipulative
acts to themselves. Nonetheless, they are often
sensitive to others’ emotions and can be quite
kind and compassionate when they feel safe.

#### Tiger Shifters

Tiger shifters are often strong and sleek, with
powerful, graceful builds, and brilliant orange
or black markings on their skin or hair and
feline facial features. They are poised, graceful,
and confident, but they also tend to be disdainful
loners. Tiger shifters have an impulse to size up
every creature they see as potential prey — a fact
that many such subjects pick up on. This can make
tiger shifters seem even more hostile, making
social situations even more difficult for them.

#### Wolf Shifters

Wolf shifters are often hairy with canine
features. They tend to have fiery tempers, but
they understand the benefits of cooperation more
naturally than most other shifters. They prefer
to live in small family units, with adults
moving on to form their own families, but in
situations where that isn’t possible (such as in
captivity, or in the confines of an urban
environment), they often fall into violence until
they have sorted out a dominance hierarchy
(it is speculated that _[[hrazhak]]_ may have
been invented by wolf shifters in such a situation
to provide a means for establishing such hierarchies
with a reduced threat of mortality).

### Self-Reliance

In both [[Sarlona]] and [[Khorvaire]], shifters
often show a preoccupation with self-reliance.
The shifters of the [[Towering Wood]] often refer
to these behaviors as “preparing for the journey
to come.” Regardless of acculturation, shifters
tend to believe that life can change surprisingly
quickly, and that one should always be ready for
whatever may come. Even when not living in an
explicitly nomadic society, shifters are often
minimalists. It is not at all uncommon even for
urban shifters to keep a bag packed and ready to
go if they should find it necessary to do so.
Many in the [[Five Nations]] believe that this is
a tradition born of the [[Silver Crusade]], when
shifters may well have had need to flee their homes
quickly, but similar traditions are found among
the shifters of the [[Tashana Tundra]] in Sarlona
as well, suggesting that rather than a response
to historical pressures, this is something deep
within the shifter psyche.

Along with this preoccupation with self-reliance,
shifters generally hold freedom in higher regard
as a virtue than most other species. To the
shifter mind, the two are directly related: it is
self-reliance that allows one to live freely.
To rely on others means sacrificing a degree of
freedom and autonomy. Shifters still join and
form communities, but they feel more comfortable
if they believe that this is a choice, and that
they _could_ choose to leave the community and
live on their own. In fact, many shifters shun
large urban centers and prefer to live in more
wild places for precisely this reason. Few
humanoids thrive in hierarchical environments,
but few bristle at them as intensely as shifters do.

### Physical Variation

Shifters are, on average, about the same size
and weight as [[humans]], but with significantly
greater variability. This is even more pronounced
in their hair, skin, and eye colors, which are
tied more to the beast within than inheritance.
