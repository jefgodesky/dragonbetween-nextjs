**Shifters** (sometimes also referred to as
**weretouched**) are a species of [[humanoids]]
noted for their bestial features. Shifters are
able to make these features even more prominent
for a time in a magico-physicological process
referred to as _shifting_.

### Origins

In the [[Five Nations]], it is commonly believed
that shifters are the product of [[humans|human]]
breeding with [[lycanthropes]], producing a hybrid
species that have some diluted features common to
natural-born lycanthropes.
{{if Shifter || EldeenReaches3 || KhorvaireHistory3}}Many
shifter cultures, including the tribes of the
[[Towering Wood]], hold that the opposite is true:
that _they_ came first, and that lycanthropes were
made _from them_, whether by the [[Wild Heart]],
the [[daelkyr]], or some other sinister force.{{/if}}

### The Beast Within

At some point in adolescence, shifter children
undergo a physical and psychological transformation
in which they come into contact with _the beast
within_. If this connection is in any way
physiological, it follows a pattern that no
genealogist, anthropologist, or sage has yet to
map.
{{if Druidry3 || EldeenReaches3}}It seems to be a
purely spiritual connection to [[Grandmother Bear]],
[[Grandfather Boar]], [[Grandfather Rat]],
[[Grandmother Tiger]], or [[Grandmother Wolf]]
(or, much more rarely, another spirit like
[[Brother Raven]]).{{/if}}

The beast within shapes a shifter on a fundamental
level. Physiologically, shifters take on the shape
of the beast, but it comes to shape them
psychologically as well, whether by the shifter’s
acceptance of its influence, or her resistance to
it. The beast within provides a raw connection to
instinct that few members of other species can
understand, which can mean an extreme of passion
and emotion that can easily dominate a shifter’s
thoughts and actions. Some shifters accept this,
while others struggle against it, to the extent
of suppressing all emotion and remaining stoic in
the face of any situation, lest their deep
passions overwhelm them. Shifters are thus
generally mercurial and hot-tempered, whether
they express that freely or strive to control it.

#### Bear Shifters

Bear shifters tend to be large and hairy. They can
often be sensitive and gentle, but they can also
be gruff and intimidating. Bear shifters can be
fiercely protective of those they love, and are
known for being stubborn and refusing to back down
from any argument or confrontation. They are also
deep sleepers and talented dreamers who frequently
become spiritual leaders in shifter communities.

#### Boar Shifters

Boar shifters tend to be large and stocky, with
a squat, powerful physique and bristly hair. They
are direct, straightforward, and honest — not
infrequently to the point of rudeness. Because
they are so honest themselves, it rarely occurs
to them to expect dishonesty from others, often
making them particularly naive. Boar shifters
are often diligent, concentrating intensely on a
single goal once they set their minds on it.
They rarely seek help from others, but don’t
hesitate to help others when they ask.

#### Rat Shifters

Rat shifters tend to be small, lean, and wiry,
with pronounced teeth and pointed noses. They are
quick and smart, with unparalleled reflexes. Rat
shifters are often jumpy and nervous, even to the
point of paranoia in extreme cases. They often
find it easy to justify dishonest or manipulative
acts to themselves. Nonetheless, they are often
sensitive to others’ emotions and can be quite
kind and compassionate when they feel safe.

#### Tiger Shifters

Tiger shifters are often strong and sleek, with
powerful, graceful builds, and brilliant orange
or black markings on their skin or hair and
feline facial features. They are poised, graceful,
and confident, but they also tend to be disdainful
loners. Tiger shifters have an impulse to size up
every creature they see as potential prey — a fact
that many such subjects pick up on. This can make
tiger shifters seem even more hostile, making
social situations even more difficult for them.

#### Wolf Shifters

Wolf shifters are often hairy with canine
features. They tend to have fiery tempers, but
they understand the benefits of cooperation more
naturally than most other shifters. They prefer
to live in small family units, with adults
moving on to form their own families, but in
situations where that isn’t possible (such as in
captivity, or in the confines of an urban
environment), they often fall into violence until
they have sorted out a dominance hierarchy.

### Self-Reliance

In both [[Sarlona]] and [[Khorvaire]], shifters
often show a preoccupation with self-reliance.
The shifters of the [[Towering Wood]] often refer
to these behaviors as “preparing for the journey
to come.” Regardless of acculturation, shifters
tend to believe that life can change surprisingly
quickly, and that one should always be ready for
whatever may come. Even when not living in an
explicitly nomadic society, shifters are often
minimalists. It is not at all uncommon even for
urban shifters to keep a bag packed and ready to
go if they should find it necessary to do so.
Many in the [[Five Nations]] believe that this is
a tradition born of the [[Silver Crusade]], when
shifters may well have had need to flee their homes
quickly, but similar traditions are found among
the shifters of the [[Tashana Tundra]] in Sarlona
as well, suggesting that rather than a response
to historical pressures, this is something deep
within the shifter psyche.

Along with this preoccupation with self-reliance,
shifters generally hold freedom in higher regard
as a virtue than most other species. To the
shifter mind, the two are directly related: it is
self-reliance that allows one to live freely.
To rely on others means sacrificing a degree of
freedom and autonomy. Shifters still join and
form communities, but they feel more comfortable
if they believe that this is a choice, and that
they _could_ choose to leave the community and
live on their own. In fact, many shifters shun
large urban centers and prefer to live in more
wild places for precisely this reason. Few
humanoids thrive in hierarchical environments,
but few bristle at them as intensely as shifters do.

### Physical Variation

Shifters are, on average, about the same size
and weight as [[humans]], but with significantly
greater variability. This is even more pronounced
in their hair, skin, and eye colors, which are
tied more to the beast within than inheritance.
