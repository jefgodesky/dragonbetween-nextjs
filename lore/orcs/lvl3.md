**Orcs** are a species of [[humanoids]] native
to [[Khorvaire]] noted for their primal
connection to [[Eberron]] and deep passions.

### Origins

[[Reacher culture|Reacher]] legends claim that
the [[Towering Wood]] is the first forest, and
that it was home to the first humanoids: the
_Ur-Oc_, in [[Orcish language|Orcish]]. Gnolls
and orcs alike maintain oral traditions of
battling in the [[Age of Demons]], and the
[[Ghaash'kala]] maintain that their ancestors
were present for the birth of the [[Binding Flame]].
This all suggests that orcs may well be the
original humanoid species of [[Khorvaire]].

Archaeological evidence shows that the orcs
were quite widespread across the continent
until {{if Dhakaan}}the [[Empire of Dhakaan]]{{/if}}
{{if !Dhakaan}}the ancient [[Goblinoids|goblinoid]]
empire{{/if}} pushed them to the margins of the
continent — the [[Shadow Marches]], the
[[Demon Wastes]], and the [[Ironroot Mountains]],
in particular. The [[Orcish language]] suggests
that there may have been a unified Orcish culture
before then, but if so, it has not existed
since then. Today, the most well-known orcish
cultures are the [[Marcher culture]], the
[[Ghaash'kala]] of the [[Labyrinth]], and the
[[Jhorash'tar]] of the Ironroot Mountains.

### Deep Passions

Few other [[humanoids]] can understand the
passions that drive an orc. There is a capacity
for passion and feeling in orcs that goes beyond
that of [[humans]], [[elves]], or [[dwarves]].
When orcs believe in something, they do so
zealously. When they grieve, it is a bottomless
pit. When they rage, it is a firestorm. Orcs are
capable of controlling their emotions — in fact,
the sheer intensity of their passions often
makes it all the more important for them to do
so, and the extra difficulty that poses makes it
something highly prized in orc societies. While
this esteemed self-control keeps orcs from
losing themselves in their emotions, they do
shape the lives of most orcs, who usually dedicate
themselves to something they feel deeply —
whether that’s a cause they believe in, vengeance
for someone lost, [[primal magic]], or something
else.

### Crepuscular Rhythms

Orcs have [[darkvision]], making them most
effective in twilight, when other creatures
cannot see as well. Orc communities are often
nominally diurnal, but most active in the hours
around sunrise and sunset, with the hours in
between spent in relative ease. This has led to
orcs being stereotyped by [[humans]] as “lazy”
because orcs are most active when humans are
either starting or ending their day.

### Physical Variation

[[Humanoids]] are known for their low (almost
non-existent) sexual dimorphism, but this, of
course, is something that varies within the
group as well. At one extreme, among [[elves]]
there is remarkably little difference between
males and females even for humanoids, but at the
other extreme are orcs. An orc female is, on
average, about three-quarters the size of an orc
male — still a small difference compared to many
[[beasts]], but noticeable compared to the slight
differences found in most humanoids.

| Measurement | Male μ   | Male σ  | Female μ | Female σ |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Height      | 78 in    | 3 in    | 58 in    | 2.5 in   |
| Weight      | 255 lbs. | 10 lbs. | 190 lbs. | 7 lbs.   |

Orc skin varies from green to tawny brown to
blue to gray. Their hair is universally black
until old age, when it begins to turn gray and
eventually white.
