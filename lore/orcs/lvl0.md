**Orcs** are a species of [[humanoids]] native
to [[Khorvaire]] noted for their primal
connection to [[Eberron]] and deep passions.

### Physical Variation

An orc female is, on average, about three-quarters
the size of an orc male — still a small difference
compared to many [[beasts]], but noticeable
compared to the slight differences found in most
[[humanoids]].

| Measurement | Male μ   | Male σ  | Female μ | Female σ |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Height      | 78 in    | 3 in    | 58 in    | 2.5 in   |
| Weight      | 255 lbs. | 10 lbs. | 190 lbs. | 7 lbs.   |

Orc skin varies from green to tawny brown to
blue to gray. Their hair is universally black
until old age, when it begins to turn gray and
eventually white.
