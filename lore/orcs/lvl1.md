**Orcs** are a species of [[humanoids]] native
to [[Khorvaire]] noted for their primal
connection to [[Eberron]] and deep passions.

### Deep Passions

Few other [[humanoids]] can understand the
passions that drive an orc. There is a capacity
for passion and feeling in orcs that goes beyond
that of [[humans]], [[elves]], or [[dwarves]].
When orcs believe in something, they do so
zealously. When they grieve, it is a bottomless
pit. When they rage, it is a firestorm. Orcs are
capable of controlling their emotions — in fact,
the sheer intensity of their passions often
makes it all the more important for them to do
so, and the extra difficulty that poses makes it
something highly prized in orc societies.

### Crepuscular Rhythms

Orcs have [[darkvision]], making them most
effective in twilight, when other creatures
cannot see as well. Orc communities are often
nominally diurnal, but most active in the hours
around sunrise and sunset, with the hours in
between spent in relative ease. This has led to
orcs being stereotyped by [[humans]] as “lazy”
because orcs are most active when humans are
either starting or ending their day.

### Physical Variation

An orc female is, on average, about three-quarters
the size of an orc male — still a small difference
compared to many [[beasts]], but noticeable
compared to the slight differences found in most
[[humanoids]].

Measurement | Male μ | Male σ | Female μ | Female σ
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Height | 78 in | 3 in | 58 in | 2.5 in
Weight | 255 lbs. | 10 lbs. | 190 lbs. | 7 lbs.

Orc skin varies from green to tawny brown to
blue to gray. Their hair is universally black
until old age, when it begins to turn gray and
eventually white.
